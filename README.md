## Election â€“ Audit Summary

This script can be modified to find the number of votes the winning candidate had in the county with the most turnout. To modify the script, count the number of votes per county for the winning candidate only. Using this number, divide this by the total number of votes in the county to get the percentage of votes the winning candidate got in the county. 

Another way this script can be modificed in the future is to gather more voter information such as voter age. You can then filter out the voters by age in each county. This will allow us to analyze the age with the most and least votes, and reach out to specific age groups to increase voting.
